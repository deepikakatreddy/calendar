# Calendar

## Description
This program is a simple HTML and JavaScript application for displaying a calendar based on user input for the month and year. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the webpage.
   - It includes dropdown menus for selecting the month and year, a button to trigger the display of the calendar, and a div element to display the generated calendar.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - CSS styles are used to enhance the visual appearance of the calendar.
   - Background color, font sizes, padding, and borders are defined to create a visually appealing layout.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - The `displayCalendar()` JavaScript function is triggered when the "Display Calendar" button is clicked.
   - It retrieves the selected month and year values from the dropdown menus.
   - Using JavaScript Date objects, it calculates the number of days in the selected month (`daysInMonth`) and the day of the week of the first day of the month (`firstDay`).
   - It dynamically generates an HTML table representing the calendar for the selected month and year.
   - Each cell of the table represents a day of the month, and empty cells are added for days before the first day and after the last day of the month.

4. **Displaying the Calendar:**
   - The dynamically generated HTML table representing the calendar is inserted into the `<div>` element with the id `calendar`.
   - The calendar is displayed on the webpage, showing the days of the selected month in a grid format.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/calendar.git
    cd calendar
    ```

2. **Open in a Web Browser:**
    - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
    - Select a month and year from the dropdown menus.
    - Click the "Display Calendar" button to view the calendar for the selected month and year.
